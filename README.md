## Description
The Student Course Management System is a web-based application designed to assist 
students in organizing and tracking their academic progress. 

This application is built upon a server-side rendering engine, Thymeleaf, and features a modern,
responsive design thanks to the integration of the Bootstrap CSS framework.
For the login, we used Spring Security.
